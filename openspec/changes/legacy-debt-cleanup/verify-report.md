## Verification Report

**Change**: legacy-debt-cleanup
**Version**: N/A (delta specs, no version headers)
**Mode**: Standard (Strict TDD inactive: `openspec/config.yaml` -> `strict_tdd: false`, `testing.strict_tdd_mode: disabled`)
**Scope of this report**: **Slice S1 only** (zero-trust close, items 26/39), **re-verification after remediation**. Slices S2-S5c are not implemented; the change-level verdict remains pending. Envelope counts (`requirements: 3/3`, `scenarios: 8/8`) are scoped to the S1 delta spec `payment-method-currency-classification` (3 requirements / 8 scenarios by document order).
**Verified revision**: `c6c767f` (remediation commit; `HEAD`). Working tree carries one uncommitted documentation-only change: a 14-line `apply-progress.md` append (GGA hook exception note). No production or test file is modified against `c6c767f`.
**Prior verdict**: `fail` (commit `00adc45`), 1 blocker / 1 critical finding. This revision supersedes it for S1.
**evidence_revision** is the SHA-256 of the colon-joined per-file SHA-256 digests of the thirteen S1 production/test files listed under "S1 Changed Files".
**Hash definition**: `build_output_hash` / `test_output_hash` are the SHA-256 of the byte-exact combined stdout+stderr captured for the command execution reported above (UTF-8, LF-joined, `Set-Content -NoNewline`), computed with `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256`.

### Completeness

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Slice S1 tasks total (`tasks.md` Phase 1) | 10 |
| Slice S1 tasks complete | 10 |
| Slice S1 tasks incomplete | 0 |
| Change tasks complete (all phases) | 10 / 66 |
| Change phases implemented | 1 of 8 (S1) |

All ten Phase 1 tasks (1.1-1.10) are checked in `tasks.md`. Phases 2-5c are unchecked, so a change-level (`pass`) verification is not yet admissible; this report verifies S1 in isolation and leaves the change-level verdict pending.

### Re-executed Evidence (verbatim)

All commands claimed in `apply-progress.md` (remediation section) were re-executed independently. Results are reported verbatim; one divergence from the claim is recorded under RESIDUAL-01.

**1. Build** - `dotnet build CommandCenter.slnx -c Release` - exit `0` - matches claim

```text
Compilación correcta.
    0 Advertencia(s)
    0 Errores
```

**2. Backend tests** - `dotnet test CommandCenter.Tests/CommandCenter.Tests.csproj -c Release` - exit `0` - matches claim on retry

```text
Correctas! - Con error:     0, Superado:  1149, Omitido:     0, Total:  1149, Duración:     7 s - CommandCenter.Tests.dll (net10.0)
```

Stability note: of five full-suite executions performed for this verification, four reported `1149/1149` and one (`--no-build`) reported `1147/1149` with two failures in `CommandCenter.Tests.CheckoutUxTests` (`UpdateCustomer_PreservesExistingPaymentsAndRecalculatesCustody`, `CanFinalize_OverrideSale_PartialPayment_ReturnsTrue_WithRegistrarAbonoLabel`). The same two tests pass 9/9 when run in isolation, and neither file is touched by S1 or by `c6c767f`. See RESIDUAL-01.

**3. Frontend tests** - `npm test` (Web.Frontend) - exit `0` - matches claim

```text
ℹ tests 271
ℹ suites 58
ℹ pass 271
ℹ fail 0
ℹ cancelled 0
ℹ skipped 0
ℹ todo 0
```

**4. Frontend lint** - `npm run lint` (Web.Frontend, oxlint) - exit `0`, no findings - matches claim

```text
> web-frontend@0.0.0 lint
> oxlint
```

**5. S1 focused filter** - `dotnet test CommandCenter.Tests/CommandCenter.Tests.csproj --no-build -c Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CloseShift"` - exit `0` - matches claim

```text
Correctas! - Con error:     0, Superado:    12, Omitido:     0, Total:    12, Duración:     2 s - CommandCenter.Tests.dll (net10.0)
```

**6. S1 web test alone** - `node --import ./test/esbuild-jsx-loader.mjs --test "src/pages/RegisterClosePage.currency-classification.test.js"` - exit `0` - matches claim

```text
✔ does not use name/substring heuristic for currency classification (2.8979ms)
✔ getMethodCurrency reads only from server-provided method.currency (0.8423ms)
✔ payload omits the currency key from declaredAmounts (0.4713ms)
ℹ tests 3
ℹ pass 3
ℹ fail 0
```

**7. Coverage gate** - `dotnet test CommandCenter.Tests/CommandCenter.Tests.csproj --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings CommandCenter.Tests/coverage.runsettings` then `python scripts/check-coverage.py CommandCenter.Tests/TestResults/7b6b3903-5965-4a33-b8aa-70f45791940a/coverage.cobertura.xml` - exit `0` - gate passes; measured rates differ from the prior snapshot (see RESIDUAL-02)

```text
Cobertura de dominio por capa (line-rate, excluye *.Migrations.*):
  Core               rate=0.8096 min=0.7000 gap_a_70%=0.0000 [OK]
  Sales.Module       rate=0.8525 min=0.8000 gap_a_70%=0.0000 [OK]
  Inventory.Module   rate=0.7937 min=0.7200 gap_a_70%=0.0000 [OK]
```

All three thresholds in the `tasks.md` Verification section (Core >= 0.70, Sales.Module >= 0.80, Inventory.Module >= 0.72) pass. `Sales.Module` (0.8525), the layer gated for this change, is above its 0.80 baseline.

**Environment note**: `TEST_POSTGRES_CONNECTION` is unset, so the Postgres-gated classes continue to early-return as vacuous passes; they do not cover any S1 path.

### S1 Finding-to-Closure Matrix

Every finding registered against the prior S1 verdict is re-checked below with runtime evidence from `c6c767f`.

| Finding | Prior severity | Closure | Fresh evidence |
|---------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| CRITICAL-01 - REQ-PMC-04 "Unknown declared payment method" 400 is not RFC 7807 | Critical / blocker | **CLOSED** (residual RESIDUAL-03) | `ShiftsController.cs:157-160` now returns `Problem(detail: ex.Message, statusCode: StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest)`. `ControllerBase.Problem(...)` yields an `ObjectResult` whose `Value` **is** a `ProblemDetails` (not a nested `ObjectResult`), so `ObjectResultExecutor.InferContentTypes` promotes the media type to `application/problem+json`. Covering tests: `CloseShiftResolverClassificationTests.CloseShift_UnknownPaymentMethodId_ReturnsProblemDetails` (line 182) asserts `ObjectResult`, `StatusCode == 400`, `ProblemDetails` body, `Status == 400` and `Detail` contains `999` (lines 201-205); `SecurityHardeningSprint2Tests.ShiftsController_UnknownDeclaredPaymentMethodId_ReturnsBadRequestWithoutCreatingClosure` (line 230) asserts `ObjectResult` + `ProblemDetails` + `Status == 400` and `RolloverSessionAfterClosureAsync` `Times.Never` (lines 283-288). Payload **is** asserted; content type **is not** asserted by any test. |
| WARNING-01 - close-path classification and diverging-name scenario have no covering test | Warning / high | **CLOSED** | Five real-path tests now execute the production `DailyClosureService` against an InMemory `SalesDbContext` with no service-behavior mock: `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync_RealService_UsdMethodClassifiedAsUsd` (line 330), `..._BsSMethodClassifiedAsBsS` (line 372), `..._DivergingName_UsesResolverClassification` (line 412), `..._UnknownMethodId_ThrowsArgumentException` (line 452), `..._ReqPmc04_ClientUsdForLocalMethod_UsesResolverClassification` (line 483). Each service is constructed as `new DailyClosureService(salesCtx)` (lines 344, 386, 426, 465, 497) and asserts the persisted `ClosureDetail.ActualAmountBsS` read back from the context (lines 363-368, 404-408, 444-448, 515-520). |
| WARNING-02 - REQ-PMC-04 "client declares USD for a local-currency method" untested | Warning | **CLOSED** (residual RESIDUAL-04) | `..._ReqPmc04_ClientUsdForLocalMethod_UsesResolverClassification` (line 483) drives a Bs.S-classified method (`"Efectivo Bs.S"`, seeded at line 486) through the real service with `Amount = 5000` and `ExchangeRate = 50`, then asserts the resolver classification governs (`LocalCurrency`, line 512), the declared amount is untouched (`5000`, line 513) and the **persisted** closure records the resolver classification (`ActualAmountBsS == 5000`, i.e. no `x rate` conversion, and `ExchangeRate == 50`, lines 519-520). |
| WARNING-03 - unauthorized exchange-rate source swap in the close path | Warning / financial | **CLOSED** | The swap is fully reverted. `DailyClosureService.ResolveEffectiveRateAsync` is deleted by `c6c767f`; the service consumes `command.ExchangeRate` only (`DailyClosureService.cs:213`). `CreateClosureCommand` gained the `ExchangeRate` parameter (`CreateClosureCommand.cs`) and `ShiftsController.CloseShift` resolves the rate with the pre-S1 call `GetTodayExchangeRateAsync()` -> `ExchangeRateResolver.ReadEffectiveTodayRateAsync` (`ShiftsController.cs:111`, `:53-56`) with the pre-S1 `exchangeRate <= 0` guard (`:112-117`). Rate semantics are therefore identical to pre-S1 (`ExchangeRateResolver`: BCV today -> last BCV history -> active-session opening rate -> 0; `ExchangeRateWriteService.cs:88-118`), the persisted `DailyClosure.ExchangeRate` snapshot is written from `command.ExchangeRate` (`DailyClosureService.cs:322`) exactly as before, and `DailyClosureController` still uses the same resolver (`DailyClosureController.cs:47-49, 140`) so the two close paths agree again. No S3 preemption: `ITodayExchangeRateProvider` (AD-6) exists only in `design.md`/`tasks.md` and in no compiled file; AD-5 (service owns transaction/persistence/rollover) is untouched and `tasks.md` 3.2/3.3/3.4/3.6/3.7 remain valid. |
| WARNING-06 - S1-added explanatory comments in production code | Warning / rule | **CLOSED** (residual RESIDUAL-05) | `git diff ef6efe4 c6c767f -- "*.cs"` adds **zero** comment lines. The remediation removed the XML `<summary>` blocks from `ShiftReportMapper.cs`, `ShiftReportDetailDto.cs`, `CreateClosureCommand.cs`, `IDailyClosureService.cs` and the inline `AD-*` rationale from `ShiftsController.cs` and `DailyClosureService.cs`. Surviving S1-authored comments are enumerated in RESIDUAL-05. Apply-progress labels for tasks 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 were corrected from "pre-existing" to "created/modified by S1" (`apply-progress.md` lines 8-11). |
| WARNING-04 - merged undeclared methods: hardcoded status and mixed units | Warning | **NOT FIXED - recorded as pending for S3** | Still present at `DailyClosureService.cs:301-313`: `"Balanced"` is hardcoded at line 313 while `DifferenceBsS` at line 310-312 can be non-zero (line 290 sets `actualAmount = 0` for cash), and for a USD method `DeclaredAmount` carries `exp.ExpectedAmountBsS` (Bs.S) while `SystemAmount` carries `PricingCalculator.ToUSD(...)`. `apply-progress.md` lines 129/94 (S3) and `tasks.md` 3.4 (AD-8 `MergeMissingMethods`/`RecalculateTotals` extraction) record it. Not silently fixed. |
| WARNING-05 - `apply-progress.md` misattributes created files as "pre-existing" | Warning / evidence trail | **CLOSED** | `apply-progress.md` lines 8, 10, 11 now state "created by S1"/"modified by S1" with an explicit "NOTE: prior apply-progress incorrectly listed ... as 'pre-existing'; corrected in remediation section." |
| WARNING-07 - `DailyClosureService.cs` exceeds the class-size ceiling | Warning / rule | **NOT FIXED - recorded as pending for S3** | File length is **504** lines (`Get-Content ... | .Count`), above the 300-500 ceiling in `docs/coding-guidelines-core.md`. `tasks.md` 3.4 (AD-8 extraction) and `apply-progress.md` line 130 record it. Not silently fixed. See RESIDUAL-06 for the label/number defect in that record. |

### Diverging-name test discrimination (WARNING-01/02 follow-up)

The requested justification that `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync_RealService_DivergingName_UsesResolverClassification` is non-tautological:

1. The method under test is the **production** service (`new DailyClosureService(salesCtx)`, line 426); no `Mock<IDailyClosureService>` participates, so the assertion cannot read back an injected constant.
2. The payment-method name `"Dólares"` is seeded into the InMemory `PaymentMethods` table (line 418) and reaches the classifier only through `GetExpectedTotalsByPaymentMethodAsync`, which reads `PaymentMethods` (`DailyClosureService.cs:66-71`) and projects `PaymentMethodName = method.Name` (line 99).
3. `PaymentMethodCurrencyResolver.Resolve` returns `USD` only when the name contains the literal `USD` (`PaymentMethodCurrencyResolver.cs:20-29`). `"Dólares"` does not, so the classification is `Bs.S`.
4. **Discrimination**: if a client-currency read or a naive name heuristic (`dolar`, `$`, `divisa`) influenced classification, the method would be classified `USD` and `actualAmountBsS` would become `declared.Amount × exchangeRate = 100 × 50 = 5000` (`DailyClosureService.cs:245-247`). The test asserts `Assert.Equal(100m, persistedDetail.ActualAmountBsS)` (line 448) after re-reading the row from the context (lines 444-447), so the regression turns the test red. The `UsdMethodClassifiedAsUsd` test (line 330) asserts the mirror case (`5000`, line 368), so a heuristic that classified everything as Bs.S is also caught.
5. A client-currency read cannot even compile on this path: `DeclaredPaymentAmount` exposes only `(PaymentMethodId, Amount)` (`CreateClosureCommand.cs`) - the currency member was deleted from the DTO and every read site.

### S1 Scenario Evidence Matrix

Actual counts taken from the delta spec headings: **3 requirements / 8 scenarios** (`openspec/changes/legacy-debt-cleanup/specs/payment-method-currency-classification/spec.md`).

| Requirement | Scenario | Covering test | Result |
|-------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| REQ-PMC-01 | Report uses the shared classifier | `CloseShiftResolverClassificationTests.ShiftReportMapper_ProducesConsistentLabels_WithResolverClassification` (line 259) | COMPLIANT - `GetReportById` delegates to `ShiftReportMapper.MapDetails` (`ShiftsController.cs:221`), which calls `PaymentMethodCurrencyResolver.Resolve`. Test passes. |
| REQ-PMC-01 | Close classifies every declared method via the resolver | `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync_RealService_UsdMethodClassifiedAsUsd` (line 330) + `..._BsSMethodClassifiedAsBsS` (line 372) | COMPLIANT - the real service classifies each declared method via the resolver (`DailyClosureService.cs:243`) and both currencies are covered end-to-end against a real context. |
| REQ-PMC-01 | A diverging method name does not change the close classification | `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync_RealService_DivergingName_UsesResolverClassification` (line 412) | COMPLIANT - `"Dólares"` classifies as `Bs.S` and the persisted amount is not rate-converted (line 448). |
| REQ-PMC-04 | Client declares USD for a local-currency method | `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync_RealService_ReqPmc04_ClientUsdForLocalMethod_UsesResolverClassification` (line 483) | COMPLIANT - resolver classification governs the amounts and the persisted closure (`ActualAmountBsS == 5000`, `ExchangeRate == 50`). Residual: the payload cannot literally carry `currency:"USD"` (see RESIDUAL-04). |
| REQ-PMC-04 | Currency omitted from the declaration | `CloseShift_EmptyDeclaredAmounts_CreatesCommandAndDelegatesToService` (line 212) | COMPLIANT - the declaration DTO carries no currency member and the close succeeds; test passes. |
| REQ-PMC-04 | Unknown declared payment method | `CloseShift_UnknownPaymentMethodId_ReturnsProblemDetails` (line 182) + `SecurityHardeningSprint2Tests.ShiftsController_UnknownDeclaredPaymentMethodId_ReturnsBadRequestWithoutCreatingClosure` (line 230) + `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync_RealService_UnknownMethodId_ThrowsArgumentException` (line 452) | COMPLIANT - HTTP 400 with an RFC 7807 `ProblemDetails` body (asserted), and the real service throws before `_context.DailyClosures.Add` (`DailyClosureService.cs:224-235` precedes `:194`) so nothing is persisted; rollover is asserted `Times.Never`. |
| REQ-PMC-05 | No local heuristic remains | `RegisterClosePage.currency-classification.test.js` -> 3 tests, all pass | COMPLIANT - the `usd`/`dolar`/`$`/`divisa` fallback is absent and no Web source sends a `currency` key. |
| REQ-PMC-05 | Diverging method name is labelled by the server value | `RegisterClosePage.currency-classification.test.js` -> "getMethodCurrency reads only from server-provided method.currency" | COMPLIANT - `getMethodCurrency` returns `'USD'` only when the server-supplied `method.currency === 'USD'`; the test asserts the helper never reads `method.name` and never calls `.includes(`. |

**Compliance summary**: 8/8 scenarios compliant, 0 UNTESTED, 0 FAILING. Requirement-level completeness: 3/3 (REQ-PMC-01, REQ-PMC-04 and REQ-PMC-05 all satisfied).

### S1 Changed Files

| File | Action | Role in S1 |
|------|--------|------------|
| `Backend.API/Controllers/ShiftsController.cs` | Modified | Delegates the closure to the service; no `request.Currency` read remains; RFC 7807 400 paths at lines 114-117 and 159; rate resolved via `GetTodayExchangeRateAsync()` |
| `Sales.Module/Services/DailyClosureService.cs` | Modified | `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync` (209-344) consumes `command.ExchangeRate`; `ResolveEffectiveRateAsync` deleted |
| `Sales.Module/Interfaces/CreateClosureCommand.cs` | Modified | `CreateClosureCommand` + `DeclaredPaymentAmount`; now carries `ExchangeRate` |
| `Sales.Module/Interfaces/IDailyClosureService.cs` | Modified | `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync`, `CloseShiftResult`, `ShiftReportDetailResult` |
| `Sales.Module/Services/ShiftReportMapper.cs` | Unchanged (comment only) | Single projection used by the report path (AD-4) |
| `Sales.Module/Services/ShiftReportDetailDto.cs` | Unchanged (comment only) | DTO moved out of the controller to fix the Sales.Module -> Backend.API layering inversion |
| `Web.Frontend/src/pages/RegisterClosePage.jsx` | Unchanged | Heuristic removed; payload no longer sends `currency` |
| `Web.Frontend/src/services/shiftApi.js` | Unchanged | JSDoc typedef only |
| `CommandCenter.Tests/Unit/CloseShiftResolverClassificationTests.cs` | Modified | 12 S1 tests: 5 real-path service tests + 7 controller/projection tests |
| `Web.Frontend/src/pages/RegisterClosePage.currency-classification.test.js` | Unchanged | 3 S1 web tests |
| `CommandCenter.Tests/SecurityHardeningSprint2Tests.cs` | Modified | Re-pointed to `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync`; unknown-method assertion upgraded to `ProblemDetails` |
| `CommandCenter.Tests/Unit/Phase7ClosureWithoutRateTests.cs` | Modified | Re-pointed; no-rate assertion upgraded to a 400 `ProblemDetails` |
| `CommandCenter.Tests/Unit/ResidualRemediationLote26Tests.cs` | Unchanged | Re-pointed in S1, `Currency` removed |

No S2+ production file appears in the S1 diff. The only S5a-shaped surface remains the `CancellationToken` on `GetExpectedTotalsByPaymentMethodAsync` (AD-12), consumed by the new service method.

### S1 Rules Compliance Audit

Checked against `docs/coding-guidelines-core.md` (the system invariants) and `openspec/config.yaml`.

| Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Money in `decimal` only, never `float`/`double` | Compliant | `declared.Amount * exchangeRate`, `expectedAmountBsS`, `diffBsS` are all `decimal` (`DailyClosureService.cs:245-249`) |
| No recalculation of historical values with the current rate | Compliant | The closure persists its own `ExchangeRate` snapshot from the command (`DailyClosureService.cs:322`); persisted closures are never recomputed |
| `AsNoTracking` on read-only paths | Compliant | New reads use `AsNoTracking` (`DailyClosureService.cs:29, 34, 45, 55, 67, 281`; `ExchangeRateWriteService.cs:94, 100`) |
| No `async void` introduced | Compliant | All new members are `async Task` |
| RBAC / Zero-Trust unchanged | Compliant | `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager,Cashier")]` and the `Driver` guard on `CloseShift` are unchanged (`ShiftsController.cs:58-65`) |
| Errors surfaced as `ProblemDetails` | Compliant for the S1 path (residual RESIDUAL-07) | CRITICAL-01 is fixed: the unknown-method 400 and the no-rate 400 both emit `ProblemDetails`. `CloseShift` still returns an anonymous-object 400 for duplicate method ids (`ShiftsController.cs:75`), scoped to S2 task 2.2 |
| No unexplained comments | Compliant for the remediation (residual RESIDUAL-05) | `c6c767f` adds no comment line to any `.cs` file; one S1-authored explanatory comment survives |
| Class file <= 300-500 lines | **Violated** | WARNING-07: `DailyClosureService.cs` is 504 lines; deferred to S3 (AD-8) |
| Entities never returned to clients | Compliant for the S1 path | The close response is `ShiftReportDto`/`ShiftReportDetailResult`; no entity appears in the S1 response |

**Audit statement**: the implementation respects the financial-arithmetic, snapshot-immutability, async and error-contract invariants. Two rule deviations remain open and both are explicitly deferred by `tasks.md` to S3 (class size) and S2 (remaining anonymous error object), not regressions introduced by the remediation.

### S1 Design Coherence

| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| AD-1 (close classification, delete `DeclaredAmountDto.Currency` and all reads, response currency is the resolver value) | Yes | `DeclaredAmountDto` has no `Currency` member (`ShiftsController.cs:249-254`) and no `request.Currency` read remains; the response currency comes from the resolver |
| AD-2 (page reads `method.currency` only; payload stops sending `currency`) | Yes | `RegisterClosePage.jsx` and the payload match the decision; asserted by the 3 web tests |
| AD-3 (`ExpectedAmountBsS` verbatim; `ActualAmountBsS = declaredNative x rate`) | Yes | `DailyClosureService.cs:245-248`; the `/rate*rate` round-trip is gone |
| AD-4 (one projection shared by report and close) | Yes | `ShiftReportMapper.MapDetails` is used by the report path; the close path duplicates the arithmetic rather than calling the mapper, so agreement is by construction of the same formula, not by a single code path (unchanged from S1) |
| AD-6 (rate via `ITodayExchangeRateProvider` -> `ExchangeRateResolver`) | Restored to the pre-S1 status quo, S3 target intact | WARNING-03 is closed by removing the unauthorized resolver; AD-6's provider is still assigned to S3 (tasks 3.2/3.3/3.4/3.7) and does not exist in compiled code |
| AD-15 (S4 client coupling; not S1) | N/A | Out of slice |

### Residual Warnings (non-blocking for S1)

- **RESIDUAL-01 (test stability, pre-existing)** - the backend suite is not deterministically green: 1 of 5 full executions reported `1147/1149` with two `CommandCenter.Tests.CheckoutUxTests` failures that pass in isolation and are unrelated to S1. Cause is test isolation/state leakage outside this change's files. Owner: not S1.
- **RESIDUAL-02 (coverage snapshot drift)** - the gate passes, but the measured rates differ from the prior report's snapshot: Core 0.8364 -> 0.8096, Sales.Module 0.8616 -> 0.8525, Inventory.Module 0.8251 -> 0.7937. The prior report's absolute values did not reproduce; all three remain above threshold.
- **RESIDUAL-03 (missing assertion)** - no test asserts the `application/problem+json` content type that CRITICAL-01's fix produces; the payload (`ProblemDetails` + `Status` + `Detail`) is asserted. The promotion is guaranteed by `ObjectResultExecutor` because `Value` is now a `ProblemDetails`, but the clause "RFC 7807" is proven by inspection, not by an assertion.
- **RESIDUAL-04 (scenario fidelity)** - the REQ-PMC-04 end-to-end test cannot literally be GIVEN `currency:"USD"`: the member no longer exists on `DeclaredAmountDto`, and no test binds a JSON payload containing an unknown `currency` member (a repository-wide search of `CommandCenter.Tests` finds no such literal). The compliant conclusion rests on structural impossibility plus the real-service assertions.
- **RESIDUAL-05 (comments)** - two S1-authored comments survive: `DailyClosureService.cs:223` (`// Validate declared method ids`, purely explanatory, no `8.x-*` marker) and `ShiftsController.cs:78` (`// Identity from JWT claims (H-API-2)`, a rewording of a pre-existing Spanish comment into a non-`8.x` traceability marker). `ShiftsController.cs:152-153` carries an allowed `8.7-B5:` marker.
- **RESIDUAL-06 (evidence record defects)** - `apply-progress.md` line 130 states the class is "537 lines" (actual: 504) and labels the class-size pending item "WARNING-05/07"; the prior report's WARNING-05 was the apply-progress misattribution (now fixed) and the class size was WARNING-07. The label mismatch makes the S3 hand-off ambiguous.
- **RESIDUAL-07 (out-of-slice, S2)** - `ShiftsController.cs:75` still returns `BadRequest(new { message = ... })` (non-RFC 7807) for duplicate declared method ids; `tasks.md` 2.2 targets exactly this site.
- **RESIDUAL-08 (test naming)** - `Phase7ClosureWithoutRateTests.ShiftsClose_WhenNoTodayBcvRateAndNoActiveSessionRate_ThrowsInvalidOperationException` now asserts a 400 `ProblemDetails` (the controller's rate guard fires first, so the mocked service throw is never reached - asserted `Times.Never` at line 182). The name no longer describes the behaviour.
- **RESIDUAL-09 (dead branch)** - `DailyClosureService.cs:214-218` still throws `InvalidOperationException` on `exchangeRate <= 0`, but the controller guards first, so the branch is unreachable from `POST /api/shifts/close`; it remains valid as defensive validation for other callers.
- **SUGGESTION (dead field)** - `DeclaredAmountDto.PaymentMethodName` (`ShiftsController.cs:252`) is still bound from the client and never read (the service uses the DB name); `CloseShiftRequest.CashierName`/`CashierCedula` remain dead too (S2 task 2.6).
- **SUGGESTION (tautological test)** - `CloseShift_DivergingMethodName_UsesResolverNotName` (line 147) still evaluates its divergence assertion inside the mock setup (lines 154-155) and asserts the mock's own output (line 178); it is now redundant given the real-path diverging test and should be deleted or strengthened.

### Change-Level Verdict

**Pending**. The change cannot receive a change-level verdict while S2-S5c are unimplemented. Append each later slice's evidence as its own section above this one; S2-S5c must also carry the resolution status of WARNING-04 (merged undeclared method lines, expected in S3/AD-8), WARNING-07 (class size, expected in S3/AD-8) and RESIDUAL-07 (duplicate-id error object, expected in S2/AD-9).

### Verdict

**PASS_WITH_WARNINGS (Slice S1)** - the remediation commit `c6c767f` closes all five findings registered against the prior verdict: CRITICAL-01 (the 400 path now emits an RFC 7807 `ProblemDetails` payload), WARNING-01 (five real-path tests execute the production `CreateClosureFromCommandAsync` against an InMemory `SalesDbContext`), WARNING-02 (the REQ-PMC-04 end-to-end scenario is covered and the diverging-name test is discriminating), WARNING-03 (the unauthorized rate source is fully reverted to the pre-S1 `ExchangeRateResolver` semantics, with `ITodayExchangeRateProvider` and AD-5/AD-6 left intact for S3) and WARNING-06 (the remediation adds no comment line and the apply-progress labels are corrected). All eight S1 scenarios and all three S1 requirements are compliant, so the verdict moves from `fail` to `pass_with_warnings`. The change carries no blockers and no critical findings; the residual warnings (RESIDUAL-01..09) are non-blocking, and WARNING-04/WARNING-07 remain deliberately deferred to S3 as recorded. S1 may be chained into S2.
